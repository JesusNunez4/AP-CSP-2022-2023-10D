#Varibles have types
x = 4 # x is of type int

#Casting
#Casting is to specify the data type of a variable
x = str (3) # x will be string or word '3'
y = int (3) # y will be number 3 
z = float (3) # z will be 3.0

#How to print a type
x = (5)
y = 'John'
print (type (x))
print (type (y))
# Note:" " is the same as '' so "x" is the same 'x'
# Case sensitivity 
a = 4

#A will NOT overwrite a

#NAMING VARIBLES:
#1 A variable name must start witha letter or a underscore 

#2 Avilable name cannot start with a number 

#3 A varible name is case sensitive
